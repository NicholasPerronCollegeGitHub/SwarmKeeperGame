//Project Desc\\
    A two player, turn-based strategy game where each player commands one of (hopefully) several different alien hives in a fight for supremacy over alien environments. Each player would start the game with a small core nest, along with a scout-strain of their chosen species. Using these, players take turns exploring the game world, identifying sources of rich biomass and material to grow their hives, and to eventually hatch combat-focused creatures to eliminate their opponent.

//Project Motivation\\
    My motivation for this project is admittedly somewhat selfish. I have been trying for a while to find games similar to this, being a strategy game with a more alien (in this case, somewhat insectoid) aesthetic.

//Project Plan\\
    I plan to begin with creating the most essential fetures (tile-based map generation {random or pre-set}, basic movement and combat mechanics, resource accumalation/spending, etc.), before moving on to more auxillary features (Hive selection, Fog of War <map is hidden until explored>, creature abilities/variety, etc.).

//Effort Estimation\\
    I am unsure of exactly how difficult this will program. I estimate that the most difficult features to create will be the players' controlled creatures/structures, along with the Fog of War mechanic, hence the flexibility and generalness of the plan above. It may end up being quite difficult to do, but as I quite enjoy this kind of work, I think ill be able to get through it in the end.
